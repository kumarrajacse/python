Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” 
Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.
Ans: 
len() is a built-in function in python.You can use the len() to get the length of the given string, array, list, tuple, dictionary, etc.
The len built-in returns the number of elements in a collection.

# testing len() 
str1 = "Welcome to  plural Python Tutorials"
print("The length of the string  is :", len(str1))

Output :

The length of the string  is : 35

# to find the length of the list

list1 = ["Tim","Charlie","Tiffany","Robert"]

print("The length of the list is", len(list1))

Output :

The length of the list is 4

Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.

Ans:
Round()
Python provides an inbuilt function round() which rounds off to the given number of digits and returns the floating point number,
 if no number of digits is provided for round off , it rounds off the number to the nearest integer.

>>> round(1.4756,2)
1.48
>>> round(1.3333,2)
1.33

abs()

The abs() function of Python's standard library returns the absolute value of the given number. Absolute value of a number is
 the value without considering its sign. Hence absolute of 10 is 10, -10 is also 10.
 If the number is a complex number, abs() returns its magnitude.

>>> abs(11.11)
11.11
>>> abs(-11.11)
11.11
